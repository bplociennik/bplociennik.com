Hi! I'm a software developer based in Pozna≈Ñ. 

Every day I mostly work with üêç and a bit in Golang.

This blog will be mostly for [me from the future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Psxktpxkc6o) to document my code solutions and find them easily in the future.

I hope you will also find here something useful :smiley:

## Hobbies
If you do not find me :computer: then probably I will be somewhere:
- around rocks, because I'm a freak of climbing [:goat:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0jMzdbEui0)
- me :running: in the woods
- in the mountains
- during winter in the nearest lake :swimmer:

or in the Roman Legions as a [Signifer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signifer).


## Work

I work currently at [Merixstudio](https://www.merixstudio.com/) as a Senior python developer. Previously I also worked at [Espeo Software](https://www.espeo.eu/) and [InStream.io](http://instream.io/pl/).
